		      I am a PhD student at <a href="https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en/"> CMAP </a> (applied mathematics lab in Ecole Polytechnique), under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~alouges/"> Fran√ßois Alouges </a> and <a href="http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lefebvre/"> Aline Lefebvre-Lepot</a>.

	      <p><strong> My research focuses on the study of micro-swimmers: living ones such as bacteria, algae and (mainly) spermatozoa, and also toy-models. 
		     I study these systems as a whole, from trying to understand and modelize, using partial differential equations and numerical methods, the mechanisms that enable them to swim. 
		     I am also interested in their controllability.
